# ExpansionmetaboData
This file contains intracellular and extacellular [U-13C]glucose tracing data for 3 different T cell expansion conditions (REP, ICM, ICM (CTL:AIMV)) using 3 different human healthy donors (D4, D6, D7).
Values are displayed as fractional enrichment out of the sum of all possible isotopologues for that metabolite.
Data has already been correction for natural 13C abundance.
